## 2. Services Provided

The **Gemini Dynamo Frontend** offers six key services, each aimed at helping users analyze and extract valuable insights from their data:

### 2.1 Key Concepts Retriever

The **Key Concepts Retriever** service allows users to extract the most important concepts and ideas from a dataset. It helps identify:

- **Main topics** within a large body of text.
- **Recurring themes** and ideas in documents or reports.
- **Core entities** (such as people, organizations, locations) mentioned across a dataset.

This service is ideal for quickly identifying key takeaways from large amounts of unstructured data.

### 2.2 Structured Data Study

The **Structured Data Study** service analyzes structured data formats (such as tables or spreadsheets) and transforms them into actionable insights. It provides:

- **Statistical summaries** of the data.
- **Trends and patterns** identified from structured datasets.
- **Relationships** between different data points.

This service is particularly useful for working with well-organized datasets that require deeper analysis or trend discovery.

### 2.3 Semantic Analysis

The **Semantic Analysis** service dives deep into the meaning of text data, identifying contextual relationships between words, phrases, and concepts. It can:

- **Analyze the meaning** behind sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents.
- **Understand the relationships** between different concepts or topics within the text.
- **Interpret context** to reveal insights that might not be obvious at first glance.

This tool is essential for any task that requires a deeper understanding of written content.

### 2.4 Topic Clustering

**Topic Clustering** groups related topics and concepts based on semantic similarity. It:

- **Clusters similar ideas** together for easy exploration.
- **Organizes topics** into clear and concise groups.
- **Visualizes relationships** between clusters, making it easier to see overarching themes.

This service is highly valuable for data categorization, content summarization, and thematic analysis.

### 2.5 Relation Mapping

The **Relation Mapping** service helps users visualize and understand the relationships between various data points or concepts. It:

- **Creates visual maps** of related concepts and their connections.
- **Identifies complex relationships** between entities.
- **Helps explore** how different topics or concepts are interlinked.

This tool is ideal for understanding networks of data, such as in social networks, research papers, or complex databases.

### 2.6 Sentiment Analysis

The **Sentiment Analysis** service analyzes text to determine the sentiment expressed within it. It can:

- **Classify text** as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Gauge the emotional tone** of reviews, social media posts, or other text.
- **Measure sentiment trends** over time.

This service is useful for tracking customer feedback, analyzing social media sentiment, or gauging public opinion.

## 4. Environment Variables

The **Gemini Dynamo Frontend** requires the following environment variables for proper integration with the backend services:

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL**: The base URL for the backend API that provides concept retrieval services.
- **NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY**: The API key used for authenticating requests to the backend services.

An example `.env.local` file configuration:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.geminidynamo.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```


Ensure you replace `your_api_key_here` with the actual API key provided by the backend.
